# Arithmetic Operators with Strings in Python
# In Python, only the + and * operators are supported for strings.

# 1. Addition (+) - Concatenates two strings
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print(result)  # Output: Hello World

# 2. Multiplication (*) - Repeats the string
str3 = "Ha"
print(str3 * 3)  # Output: HaHaHa

# Other arithmetic operators like -, /, //, %, ** are not supported for strings and will raise errors.
# Example of unsupported operation:
# print(str1 - str2)  # This will raise a TypeError

# Summary:
# + : Concatenates strings
# * : Repeats strings
# Other arithmetic operators are not valid for strings.
